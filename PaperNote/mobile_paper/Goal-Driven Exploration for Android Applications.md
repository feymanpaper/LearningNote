## Introduction
The core idea behind GOALEXPLORER is to first statically model the application’s UI screens and transitions between these screens, producing a Screen Transition Graph (STG). Then, GOALEXPLORER uses the STG to guide the dynamic exploration of the application to the particular target of interest: an Android activity, API call, or a program statement.

In this paper, we introduce a goal-driven app exploration approach and the associated tool, called GOALEXPLORER, which directly triggers a particular functionality of interest. GOALEXPLORER combines a novel approach for modeling an app User Interface (UI) as a Screen Transition Graph (STG) with a dynamic STG-driven app exploration technique. Given
a particular target of interest – an Android activity, API call, or a code statement, it automatically builds an executable script that swiftly triggers the target.

Our analysis shows that more than 90% of the 100 top free Android apps on Google Play contain at least one fragment, background task, and broadcast receiver; 87% of the apps contain menus and 64% – drawers. Moreover, 63% of the apps have at least one screen transition originating from a fragment and 34% – from a background task or broadcast receiver.

## Contribution
Contributions. This paper makes the following contributions: 1) It defines the problem of goal-driven exploration for mobile apps: efficiently triggering a functionality specified by the user. 2) It shows that existing approaches are insufficient for performing goal-driven exploration. 3) It presents a technique for constructing a static model of an app UI called Screen Transition Graph (STG) and using STG to generate an executable script that triggers a specific functionality of interest defined by the user. 4) It implements the proposed technique in a tool named GOALEXPLORER and empirically shows its effectiveness on the 93 benchmark apps used in related work and 95 top Google Play apps. Our implementation of the GOALEXPLORER and its experimental evaluation package are available online [33].

## Background
**App Components. Android apps are built from four main types of components [34] – activities, services, broadcast**. Android apps are built from four main types of components [34] – activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers. Activities are the main UI building blocks that facilitate the interactions between the user and the app. Services perform tasks that do not require a UI, e.g., prefetching files for faster access or playing music in the background after the user has switched to other activities. Broadcast receivers are components that respond to notifications. A broadcast can originate from (i) the system, e.g., to announce that the battery is low, (ii) another app, e.g., to notify that a file download is completed, or (iii) from other app components, e.g., to notify that the login was completed successfully. Content providers manage access to data, e.g., for storing and retrieving contacts.

**App UI Structure.** An application screen is represented by an activity “decorated” by additional UI components, such as fragments, menus, dialogs, and navigation drawers [34]. Fig. 3 depicts such a modular composition of screens. The solid box in Fig. 3(a) highlights the container activity; its two hosted fragments are highlighted in Fig. 3(b). A fragment is a re-usable UI component with its own lifecycle and event handling. A fragment can be instantiated in multiple activities and must always be hosted by at least one activity. Its lifecycle is directly affected by the owner activity, e.g., when the owner activity is destroyed, all of its hosted fragment instances are also destroyed. Fragment instances can be added, replaced, or removed from the host activities through the FragmentTransaction APIs, forming different screens of the same activity. Multiple fragments can exist in a single screen, as in Fig. 3(b); a screen can have any number of fragments or no fragments at all.

Menus and navigation drawers are UI components used primarily to provide additional options to the user, such as adjusting settings or launching new activities. Fig. 3(c) shows the activity with a menu opened, which allows the user to access system-wide actions, such as settings and search. Fig. 1(a) shows a drawer that occupies most of the screen and contains buttons for navigating to other parts of the app. Dialogs are small windows that prompt the user to take an action before the app can proceed with its execution, e.g., to agree to granting access to the device location. Menus, navigation drawers, and dialogs must be hosted by either an activity or a fragment. UI components are composed of widgets, such as Buttons and TextViews. ViewGroups are invisible containers used for grouping the widgets and specifying their layout before placing them inside the UI components. Users mostly interact with UI widgets and are typically unaware of the app and UI components and their lifecycle
