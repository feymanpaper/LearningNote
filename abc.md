### Comments for authors

1. Methodological Rigor: The paper introduces a tool named AgeingDroid, designed to detect accessibility issues (AFE issues) within mobile applications tailored for the elderly. The authors have collected and analyzed 691 real-world AFE issues from 31 popular commercial applications through a large-scale empirical study. Systematic steps were followed, including identification of AFE issue candidates, confirmation, and development and evaluation of the tool. However, further clarification is needed on whether this tool can address the challenges posed by customized widgets and WebView technology.
2. Relevance of the Contribution to SE: This research is highly relevant to the field of software engineering as it addresses the growing issue of making mobile applications more user-friendly and accessible to the elderly population. By identifying and resolving AFE issues, this work contributes to promoting more inclusive design practices.
3. Novelty: The main innovation of the paper lies in its focus on the unique accessibility needs of the elderly when using mobile applications and the development of the AgeingDroid tool to detect these issues. This appears to be a novel area of research, as previous studies have largely concentrated on general accessibility issues.
4. Verifiability and Transparency: The authors have provided a public dataset, AFE-101, and the tool AgeingDroid, which enhances the verifiability and transparency of the research. However, it is necessary to ensure the availability of these resources so that community members can reproduce the experimental results.
5. Overall Comments: The paper introduces AgeingDroid, a pioneering tool for enhancing elderly accessibility in mobile apps, yet necessitates further clarification on its adaptability to complex app features and a more comprehensive comparative analysis with existing tools to validate its utility.

### Questions for Rebuttal

1. In Section 3.2, it is mentioned that "Prior research also found that ageing people hardly use the deep, complicated logical functionalities." However, in Section 5.1, the description states that "UITraverser performs a depth-first search to scrape every ageing-fit GUI page of the ageing-fit app under test within a given time budget." Are these two statements contradictory, and if so, why not consider a breadth-first traversal strategy?
2. Section 5.1 mentions that "For each traversed GUI page, UITraverser checks the GUI page against the rule and discards GUI pages violating the rule." However, are there any interfaces that do not conform to ageing-fit design but may trigger deeper aged-fit designed interfaces? If these interfaces are discarded directly, it would not be possible to traverse deeper aged-fit designed interfaces.
3. In Section 5.1, the detection of Small text, Small icon, and Missing prompt is mainly based on pattern matching methods, which could lead to false positives and false negatives. For instance, the detection of Small text and Small icon is merely based on relative size; if the overall size of the text or icon is relatively large, it could lead to false positives. For Missing prompt, the boundary of the icon might be difficult to determine, potentially misidentifying text from other components as the icon's text, leading to false negatives. Do you plan to improve the semantic recognition capability of AgeingDroid for controls in future work using deep learning or other advanced technologies?
4. Section 6.1 mentions that "For GAScanner, we launched every ageing-fit app and manually navigated to every considered GUI page." Does this approach potentially lead to discrepancies between the interfaces traversed by GAScanner and AgeingDroid, affecting the accuracy of the experimental data? Additionally, AgeingDroid is an automated testing traversal tool, but it was not compared with other automated testing traversal tools in the experiment.
5. In the evaluation experiment, how did you ensure that the selected 31 applications represent the broad needs of the target user group?
