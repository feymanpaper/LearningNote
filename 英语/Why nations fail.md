I am going to talk about why nations fails and why nations succeed as well, which is really about why some countries are poor and some countries are prosperous. It turns out you can tell a lot about the answers to that question by looking at the Korea peninsula at night.

If you look at Korea peninsula at night, you see some obvious things. The south Korea, has a lot of light , electricity. North Korea, on the other hand, is rather dark. There you can see a spot of light. That is probably the presidential palace in Pyongyang. 

Now, there could be different reasons why North Korea is dark at night. It could be North Koreans have electricity and light bulbs, but they just think candles are more romantic. It could be , on the other hand, that North Koreans have electricity and light bulbs, but they are just trying to reduct their carbon footprint. I think, however, the more plausible explanation is that actually North Koreans don't have access to the types of technologies like electricity, power, and light bulbs that South Koreans do. And that enormously restricts their economic potential. So one thing we know about the difference between poor countries and rich countries is that poor countries, like North Korea, tend to have much worse technology than rich countries. 

Let me tell you about some other things we know about the differences between poor countries and rich countries. Poor countries have much less educated people. They tend to have much less healthy people. They live shorter lives. They have much worse government services, like infrastructure. 

So, here it is the idyllic driving scene in a part of the world, where I do a lot of research, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is what they called, somewhat ironically in the Congo, Interstate No.1. And you can see that driving on Interstate No.1, you spend a lot of time digging you car out of sand and mud. That is the dry season. If it was the rainy season, forget it. You are not going anywhere.
